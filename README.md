# Personal Portfolio

``(ver. 09/07/2021)``

Here is a portfolio of work that showcases the skills I've learned in Web Dev bootcamp. This will be instrumental in helping me find employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. Since I will just be starting out in the industry, a well-designed and functional portfolio is an especially important way to showcase the projects that have been successful.

## Versions
09/11/2021:
* restructured into a React framework. I had to undo the Javascript file I used to store the project information and will re-do that code in the near future
* added two more projects to Work section

08/11/2021:
* added Javascript to store updated project information for ease of use and dynamically rendering elements. This will cut down the hardcoded HTML as well
* added a modal to display project screenshots
* added a small footer
* added comments to Javascript and HTML

07/18/2021:
* rewrote HTML and CSS completely as I actually had projects to showcase!

06/22/2021:
* built first portfolio page with mock projects

## Resources

I used the Pure CSS library to style the site, as well as the lessons learned previous bootcamp lessons.

* W3Schools
* MDN
* Pure CSS
